## 1. Project Setup

- ✅ Initialize a new npm project
- ✅ Set up TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Configure linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- ✅ Set up a build process (e.g., using tsc or a bundler like webpack)
- ✅ Configure testing framework (e.g., Jest)

## 2. Core Functionality

- ✅ Implement basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- [ ] Create utility functions for type checking and conversion
- [ ] Implement common mathematical constants (pi, e, etc.)
- [ ] Add basic trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- [ ] Implement logarithmic and exponential functions

## 3. Advanced Mathematical Operations

- [ ] Add advanced trigonometric functions (asin, acos, atan, etc.)
- [ ] Implement hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh)
- [ ] Add functions for working with radians and degrees

- [ ] Add functions for greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM)

## 4. Expression Parsing and Evaluation

- [ ] Develop a lexer for tokenizing mathematical expressions
- [ ] Create a parser for building an abstract syntax tree (AST)
- [ ] Implement an evaluator for interpreting the AST
- [ ] Add support for variables in expressions
- [ ] Implement function support in expressions

## 5. Unit Conversions

- [ ] Define a system for representing units
- [ ] Implement conversions for common units (length, mass, time, etc.)

- [ ] Implement vector operations (dot product, cross product)
- [ ] Add support for solving systems of linear equations

## 7. Complex Numbers

- [ ] Define a complex number data structure
- [ ] Implement arithmetic operations for complex numbers
- [ ] Add support for complex-specific functions (argument, conjugate)
- [ ] Extend existing functions to work with complex numbers

## 8. Statistical Functions

- [ ] Implement basic statistical functions (mean, median, mode)
- [ ] Add functions for variance and standard deviation
- [ ] Implement correlation and covariance functions
- [ ] Add probability distributions (normal, binomial, etc.)

## 10. Documentation

- [ ] Set up a documentation generation tool (e.g., TypeDoc)
- [ ] Write comprehensive JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- [ ] Create a user guide with examples
- [ ] Develop an API reference
- [ ] Add installation and getting started instructions

## 11. Testing

- ✅ Write unit tests for all core functions

- [ ] Optimize memory usage

## 13. Publishing

- ✅ Choose an appropriate open-source license
- ✅ Set up npm package configuration
- ✅ Create a comprehensive README.md
- ✅ Add contribution guidelines
- ✅ Publish the initial version to npm
- ✅ Set up a changelog to track versions and updates
