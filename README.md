# Samasya

Samasya is a TypeScript-based mathematical library inspired by math.js, designed to provide a comprehensive set of mathematical functions and utilities for JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations
- Advanced mathematical functions (coming soon)
- Expression parsing and evaluation (coming soon)
- Unit conversions (coming soon)
- Matrix and vector operations (coming soon)
- Complex number support (coming soon)
- Statistical functions (coming soon)
- Symbolic computation (coming soon)



## Installation

You can install Samasya using npm:

```bash
npm install samasya
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Samasya:

```typescript
typescript
import { add, multiply, divide, subtract } from 'samasya';
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
console.log(multiply(4, 5)); // Output: 20
console.log(divide(10, 2)); // Output: 5
console.log(subtract(7, 3)); // Output: 4
```


## API Reference

Currently, Samasya supports the following basic arithmetic operations:

- `add(a: number, b: number): number`
- `subtract(a: number, b: number): number`
- `multiply(a: number, b: number): number`
- `divide(a: number, b: number): number`

More functions will be added in future releases.
